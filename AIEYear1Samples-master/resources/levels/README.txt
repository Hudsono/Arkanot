Level files are checked sequentially; with file name prefix levelN.txt, with N being numbered 1-99, etc.

Level files are formatted to show where each brick is placed on the 20x13 play area grid--characters represent brick types:
 - '0' or '-' represent an empty space.
 - 'w' = White
 - 'r' = Red
 - 'g' = Green
 - 'b' = Blue
 - 'y' = Yellow
 - 'c' = Cyan
 - 'm' = Magenta
 - 'o' = Orange
 - 's' = Silver
 - 'G' = Gold
 - 'D' = DOH, the final boss entity.

Notice that Green bricks are denoted with a lower-case 'g', whereas Gold bricks are denoted with an upper-case 'G'.
